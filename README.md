# Spectors_project
This repository contains the Python scripts and ancillary files that were developed as part of the research described in the paper "Sen2Grass: A Cloud-Based Solution to Generate Field-Specific Grassland Information Derived from Sentinel-2 Imagery" (https://www.mdpi.com/2624-7402/3/1/118), which in turn was part of the Spectors project (https://spectors.eu/wordpress/).
